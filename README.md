# CourtListener Data Cleaning
- Filter data to get unique cases
- Summary data on: total cases overtime by year, data on cases that are finished vs. ongoing, the court location of the cases (counts of the court locations for the 2023 cases, and total count since we begin the tracking), and then nature of suit of cases (for cases in 2023 and from previous years)
